Implementing a deep learning solution for a Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-claims-severity

Allstate insurance is trying to predict the severity of an insurance claim based on multiple variables (continuous and categorical).

Here, we try various deep learning models in Keras to try to minimize the validation and out of sample error.

The files and datasets descriptions are:

kerasModels.py: The python script with code for deep learning models I tried. Experimented with number of nodes, number of hidden layers etc.

trainingTest.csv: datafile containing data for input variabels for training and test datasets. We will extract training and test data from this file

training.csv: the training dataset. We will extract response variable for training from this file
